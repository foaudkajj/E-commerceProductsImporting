# E-commerceProductsImporting
A WinForms app which made to get products from Turkish N11 and CarrefourSA websites then compare them.

- I've done my best to follow Clean Architecture and OOP rules.
- Selenium used to get products from the websites automatically.
- For DB operations, EntityFramework is used.
